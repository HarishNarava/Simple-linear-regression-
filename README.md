# SAT Score and GPA Regression Analysis

## Description
This repository contains a dataset and corresponding analysis to predict GPA based on SAT scores using linear regression models. The analysis includes a custom-built linear regression model from scratch and a comparison with scikit-learn's linear regression model.

## Dataset
The dataset contains two features:
1. `sat_score` - The SAT scores of students.
2. `gpa` - The GPA of students (target variable).

## Files
- `dataset.csv`: The dataset file containing SAT scores and GPA.
- `custom_linear_regression.py`: Python script implementing a linear regression model from scratch.
- `scikit_learn_regression.py`: Python script utilizing scikit-learn's linear regression model.
- `comparison.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook comparing the performance of the custom-built model and scikit-learn's model.
